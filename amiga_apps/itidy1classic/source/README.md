iTidy is a Workbench utility for AmigaOS that automatically arranges icon layouts and adjusts drawer window sizes across entire directory trees.

It’s designed for anyone who actively works with their Workbench layout, whether that’s organising game libraries, maintaining project directories, tidying development trees, or cleaning up after large file operations. iTidy removes the repetitive manual work of repositioning icons and resizing windows, letting you bring order back to your Workbench in a consistent, repeatable way.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Icon Grid Layout** - Intelligent icon positioning with configurable spacing and sorting
- **Smart Window Resizing** - Aspect ratio control with overflow handling for large directories
- **Recursive Processing** - Process entire directory trees in one operation
- **LHA Backup System** - Create restore points before making changes
- **Default Tool Validation** - Find and fix missing or invalid default tool paths
- **Multiple Sort Options** - Folders First, Files First, Mixed, with reverse sorting

### Advanced Options
- Configurable icon spacing (X/Y)
- Multiple aspect ratios (Tall, Square, Compact, Classic, Wide, Ultrawide)
- Overflow strategies (horizontal, vertical, or balanced expansion)
- Column width optimization
- Icon vertical alignment control (top, middle, bottom)
- Min/max icons per row with auto-calculation
- Max window width limits (% of screen)
- Hidden folder filtering
- NewIcons border stripping (requires icon.library v44+)

### Supported Icon Formats
- Classic/Standard icons (all AmigaOS versions)
- NewIcons (extended color icons)
- OS3.5/OS3.9 Color Icons
- GlowIcons (both NewIcons-style and Color Icons versions)

## Requirements

- **OS**: AmigaOS Workbench 3.0 or newer
- **Memory**: At least 1MB free RAM
- **Storage**: At least 1MB free disk space (more for backups)
- **Optional**: LhA (required for backup/restore features)
  - Must be installed in `SYS:C` path
  - Download from [Aminet](http://aminet.net/package/util/arc/lha)

## Installation

1. Extract the iTidy archive to your desired location (e.g., `SYS:Utilities/iTidy`)
2. Ensure LhA is installed if you want to use backup features
3. Double-click the iTidy icon to launch

## Quick Start

1. **Launch iTidy** - Double-click the iTidy icon on Workbench
2. **Select Folder** - Click "Browse..." and choose the folder to tidy
3. **Choose Options**:
   - Set icon order (Folders First, Files First, or Mixed)
   - Enable "Cleanup subfolders" for recursive processing
   - Enable "Backup icons" to create restore points
4. **Click Start** - iTidy processes the folder(s) and arranges icons
5. **Restore if Needed** - Use "Restore Backups..." to undo changes

**Tip**: Try iTidy on a small test folder first to see how the options work!

## Main Features Explained

### Recursive Processing
Process entire directory trees in one operation - perfect for tidying large WHDLoad collections, archive extractions, or project folders with many subdirectories.

### Backup & Restore System
- Creates LHA archives of `.info` files before making changes
- Restore previous layouts with one click
- View and manage backup sessions
- Separate backup system for default tool changes

### Default Tool Analysis
Scan directories for icons with missing or invalid default tools and fix them:
- Identify broken default tool paths
- Batch replace tools across multiple icons
- PATH-based tool resolution
- Automatic backup before changes

### Smart Window Sizing
- Multiple aspect ratio presets
- Configurable overflow handling
- Screen width limits
- Automatic column calculation
- Window positioning options (center, keep, near parent, no change)

## Development

iTidy is written in C89/C99 for AmigaOS 3.x using:
- **Compiler**: VBCC cross-compiler (v0.9x)
- **SDK**: Amiga SDK 3.2 (targeting Workbench 3.0 compatibility)
- **Target**: 68000/68020 (no FPU/MMU required)
- **GUI**: Native GadTools (Workbench 3.0 gadgets only)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clean build
make clean && make

# Incremental build
make

# Build with console output (debugging)
make CONSOLE=1
```

Build output appears in `build/amiga/` and final binaries in `Bin/Amiga/`.

For development details, see `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.

## Safety & Disclaimer

**Important**: iTidy is hobby software provided as-is. While tested on real Amiga systems, bugs may exist.

- iTidy only modifies `.info` files and Workbench drawer/window layout information
- Your data files are never touched
- The backup system helps roll back changes, but is not a replacement for regular backups
- **Always maintain proper system backups before processing important directories**
- Try on test folders first, especially for large operations

**Use at your own risk.** The author accepts no responsibility for data loss, corruption, or other issues.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

### Icons Appear Misaligned
Update icon.library to v44+ for proper OS3.5+ color icon support, or convert icons to NewIcons/classic format.

### Window Positions Not Updating
Close and reopen drawer windows, or restart Workbench to see position changes.

### Slow Processing on Large Trees
Processing thousands of folders takes time on real hardware - this is normal. Process in chunks for very large collections.

### "Unable to open your tool" Errors
Use the "Fix Default Tools..." feature to scan for and repair missing default tool paths.
